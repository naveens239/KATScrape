# KATScrape

The tool (initially) is intended to inform a lawyer (who has subscribed to the tool) to know whether there are cases that he/she has to appear in court on a given date.


You can find a sample page of the daily Cause List here:
http://keralaadministrativetribunal.gov.in/ciskat/pages/cause_list_home.php?type=search&dte=09/12/2016&court=1

On a basic level, the tool should parse the list and display how many cases have been posted on a given day. For example:

See the Matters Before KAT on 09-12-2016.pdf and 20-12-2016.pdf to see the ideal output.
